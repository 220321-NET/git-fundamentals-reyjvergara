It is very important to specify what files from an import statement you 
are bringing over. The issue is not because of resource management, but 
rather it is because of the risk of two data structures from different imports
can ruin the software. For example, Java before did not have List in utils, 
then when it did, the import statment that previously implemented Lists 
screwed everything up. The interpreter could not differentiate between the
two same-named functions. Not all languages run the risk of this confusion,
but keep that in mind.
